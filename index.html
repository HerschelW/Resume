                    <p>April 2011 - July 2011</p>
                </li>
                <ul class="job">
                    <li><p>Shortly upon returning from AIT I was requested to depart to Lisbon ND as they were in the midst of a flood. My duties there were to patrol the dike and ensure there were no ruptures. My partner and I were on rotating 12 hour shifts with another pair. This duty lasted two weeks.</p></li><br>
                    <li><p>One week after returning from Lisbon, I volunteered to deploy with an advanced party to Bismarck ND. Large portions of the city were flooded and my unit was in charge of regulating the flow of major intersections to allow free passage of the trucks hauling sand to the dikes being built. I was partnered with another soldier and, again, we were on 12 hour rotating shifts. However, with our unit being located outside the city and the scale of the operation - we were limited to 4 hours downtime (to include sleep and basic hygiene); we essentially were working 20 hours a day, 7 days a week. This lasted shortly over a month.</p></li><br>
                    <li><p>I, once again, volunteered for an advanced party, to Minot ND, upon returning from Bismarck. The situation in Minot, at the time, was even worse than Bismarck. For the first week there, I performed traffic control operations as I had in Bismarck. Once the rest of the Military Police arrived, I was reassigned to the Field Maintenance Shop and assisted in keeping our vehicles running - they were becoming problematic from being ran so hard in Bismarck and Minot. I was on 12 hour shifts with my maintenance team. Together we successfully maintained 31 vehicles and kept all but two in operational condition. This lasted another month.</p></li>

                <ul class="job">
                    <li><p>During mid April, Fargo was under flood watch. For the first week, my duties were to guard the temporary dike - preventing anyone from crossing it or walking along it as it was deemed too hazardous. Afterwards, I was assigned to the TOC (Tactical Op Center) and operated the radios. This lasted two weeks, total.</p></li><br>
                    <li><p>During mid May, I was assigned to a group of first responders consisting of other 191 soldiers as well as 188th Air Defense Artillery soldiers. We were deployed to Carrington ND, as their dam was going to rupture - so we were told. We were partnered up with Border Patrol as well as the local Sheriff's Department to help evacuate and restrict entrance into Carrington. As well as this, I was routinely sent up, with a partner, to survey the top of the dam and ensure that it was still holding. The dam never broke and this flood duty lasted two weeks.</p></li><br>
